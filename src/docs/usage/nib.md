### Using nib with ME Bootstrap

**ME Bootstrap** is highly inspired by [nib](http://visionmedia.github.io/nib/).

As ME Bootstrap and nib shares some functions & mixins names, **it's not a great idea** to use nib and ME Bootstrap together.

In simple terms : importing **ME Bootstrap** *after* **nib** will break some of nib's features, and importing **nib** *after* **ME Bootstrap** will break some of ME Bootstrap' features.

ME Bootstrap has been coded in the way to provide a complete *alternative* to nib.

If you look after some features of nib that you don't find in ME Bootstrap, create an [issue topic](https://github.com/krkn/me-bootstrap/issues) to request it, or, even better if you can, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/krkn/me-bootstrap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
