### Included in compilation with third-party tools

To use **ME Bootstrap** with third-party tools like [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) or [Prepros](http://alphapixels.com/prepros/), you should include **ME Bootstrap** on your project by yourself. You can download it [on github](https://github.com/krkn/me-bootstrap/releases).
